# Exercise using Nav Bar and Grid System from Bootstrap

## Create a Simple photo gallery page using Bootstrap NavBar and Grid System
The nav bar doesn't have to be fully functional and starter code is provided below. Use a Bootstrap Grid to display the 9 images referenced below. 

The main goal of this exercise is to become more comfortable with the Bootstrap Grid System used to position content on your web pages.

Experiment with the provided Nav Bar as you see fit.

### Starter Code
To help you get started and focus on building the display grid, please start with the bootstrap_starter.html file contained in this repository. It provides you the starting nav bar, a few simple inline styles, as well as references to 9 online images you can use in your grid.

###BONUS: Create additional HTML pages and link them to the actions in the Nav Bar.
